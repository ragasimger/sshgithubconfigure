To generate the ssh key:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@gmail.com"
    
    The shell will ask you to give the path of file/folder where the ssh key needs to be located, then give the full path like: C:\Users\regmi/.ssh/id_ragasimger123

Then run this command
    ssh-add C:\Users\regmi/.ssh/id_ragasimger123

    The identity needs to be added.

    In case of this error:

    "Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory"
        Run the command on git bash shell:
            eval "$(ssh-agent)"




And add the config(without any file extension) file like this:

# ReverseEra
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# RagasImger
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ragasimger


# RagasImger123
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ragasimger123
